CarsGameWebGL is an implementation of a car game idea in WebGL.
The basic idea is to not crash on the traffic that is randomly coming down the road. 
The game allows the player to change camera view and day/night time. 
The closer the car is to the sidewalk the stronger is the force pushing it to the sidewalk.
